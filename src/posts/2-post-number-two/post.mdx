How to Remove Green Halo from green-screen objects in Photoshop

1. Put a new empty layer directly above the masked image layer.

2. Set the blending mode of that empty layer to color

3. Alt click on the border between the empty layer and masked layer in the layers panel. A small down arrow will appear to indicate the new layer is clipped to the masked layer below

4. Take a soft brush and click with the Alt key to pick up colour from the head. 
  - Brush over the edge - onto the new empty layer. 
  - The green colour will change to the head colour. 
  - The clipping mask will prevent you painting over the edge. 
  - Work round the edges - alt clicking to change colour where needed.

<!-- ```jsx
import React from "react"

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <section className="counter">
      <h4>show some love to MDX</h4>
      <h4>likes {count}</h4>
      <button className="btn btn-danger" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        i like mdx
      </button>
    </section>
  )
}
export default Counter
