**Songwriting is hard.** Except when you are in that magic flow where, for the briefest of moments, 
it all seems effortless. I can't get there all of the time, or even most of the time. But here is 
one of a few different ways I set myself up to write a song from start to finish.

**Step 1:**
I Always have an option nearby to record myself, should inspiration strike. It could happen in
the car, in the middle of the night, in the shower, or anywhere else. And I need to be ready to
capture it when it does.

I use an app call Voice Recorder (available on Google Play) but any recorder will do, as long as
you are able to keep it with you at all times.

When a melody or lyrics (or both!) pops into my head, I record it. It doesn't have to be good.
It doesn't have to be anything at that point. It just needs to be the beginning of an idea 
that you can flesh out later.

Many times I will record the melody using jibberish lyrics that just sort of vaguely sounds
*right*. And many times, this ends up being helpful later on. More on that in a bit.

**Step 2:**
Now it's time to try to build on my idea. At this point, I'll pick up a guitar and try to figure
out what chord progression goes with the idea. Or, sometimes lyrics start to pop into my head
and I will jot those down for later.

Now hopefully, I have the basic chord progression, a rough melody, and some jibberish lyrics.
It's time to record myself playing the chords and humming the melody. The goal here is to have 
a stronger version of my idea, slightly more in focus that I can reference.

**Step 3:**
It's time to try to add a chorus and/or a refrain. And keep trying to add more lyrics. This is 
the part where I am trying to be an antenna more than anything else. This may sound strange
but hear me out.

I'm not sure that songs even come *from* me, to be honest. Once I am at this point, with the bare
bones of what could be something meaningful, then I am in listening mode. Listening for guidance as 
to where to go next. Listening to the jibberish lyrics, trying to pluck words out. Listening
to silence. Listening to my inner voice. What am I thinking about right now? What matters
to me right this minute? What kind of mood am I in?

Then either things start to happen, or they don't. When they do, it's a great feeling. Words
start to come together. Lyrics and intent begin to solidify. Maybe I find the perfect refrain
for my verses. Ideally, it's starting to sound like a song.

**Step 4:** 
Now I record myself using a multi-track recorder. These days I have been using a Tascam 8 track
Recorder. I usually use two mics, one for guitar, one for vocals. The goal here is to play
it all the way through, without making a mistake.

**Step 5:**
Now I export those tracks and import them into my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). The DAW I 
use is called <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reaper</a>. Technically it is free. But it's so awesome, that if you find yourself
using it often, I highly recommend paying for it. 

So I import those tracks into Reaper, then I start cleaning them up. I'll add a few effects.
Maybe a synth. When I think it is sounding ok, I render it as a wav file. And that's it,
I have a new song.
